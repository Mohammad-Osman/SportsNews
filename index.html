          <p class="hl1Detail">Liverpool beat Spurs 2-0 to be crowned European Champions for the sixth time. The Reds were fast out of the
            blocks and won a controversial penalty after only 23 seconds. Mohamed Salah tucked it away and Liverpool never looked back.
            Despite fighting bravely Spurs couldn’t get back into the match and Divock Origi made the game safe when he scored
            in the 87th minute.</p>

          <p class="hl2Detail">A concept logo for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games (above) has got creatives debating the merits of its design.
            The unofficial logo, created by designer Daren Newman, has been praised for elegantly capturing the spirit of the games and
            the Japanese city, although it's also prompted people to defend the actual Tokyo 2020 identity. The idea for the logo was
            recently posted by Newman on his social media channels. The design plays with the shapes of the Olympic rings and makes
            them read '2020'. It also fills in the red ring to make it look like the rising sun disc found on Japan's flag.</p>

          <p class="hl3"> <span class="colortext3">Karachi Kings</span> wins the PSL 2019 final.</p>
          <p class="hl3Detail">KARACHI: Babar Azam on Tuesday led Karachi Kings to their first Pakistan Super League victory after
            defeating Lahore Qalandars at the National Stadium.
            Karachi Kings’ coach Wasim Akram has dedicated the win to Dean Jones, saying that it's the late Jones' hard work
            that had brought this about.
            Although Lahore-born Babar Azam's unbeaten 63 would likely steal the headlines, the victory was actually built on
            the hard work done by Karachi's unheralded,
            uncapped and unknown medium-pacers Umaid Asif, Waqas Maqsood and Arshad Iqbal.</p>
